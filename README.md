## Project Description:
- In this Project, a Super Market List page was developed, a Front-End Project, using HTML, CSS and Java Script. On the page we can find
a simple design, but very functional, in the product field, we describe the product of our preference, and its value, when clicking on the registration button, the System
creates a register with the product, and the value entered in the fields, in addition to adding all registered products.

- The project has the functionality of showing a Supermarket List Register, with the product and the value, a dynamic page, where it is saved
everything we register on the list, and even adds up all the products we register, a very functional page.

- Next we have a small instructional video, where we show an example of how the Dynamic Super Market List page works.
